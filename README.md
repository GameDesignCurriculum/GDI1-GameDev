## IMPORTANT NOTES

2. Your instructor may occasionally provide updates to the repository (e.g. new or updated starter code).   If so, these will appear as **GitHub Classroom: Sync Assignment** pull requests.  You **should** merge these pull requests if you receive them.  If in doubt, check with your instructor.
