# Game Development in Unity Year 1
This repository will be used to hold and track your work in the CodeHS Game Development in Unity Year 1 course.

## IMPORTANT NOTES
1. Your instructor may occasionally provide feedback on your submissions in the **Feedback** pull request.  You may respond to any feedback comments in that request, but you should not **merge** or **close** that pull request unless told to do so by your instructor.
2. Your instructor may occasionally provide updates to the repository (e.g. new or updated starter code).   If so, these will appear as **GitHub Classroom: Sync Assignment** pull requests.  You **should** merge these pull requests if you receive them.  If in doubt, check with your instructor.

## Creating a Unity Project in this Repository
From the repository Dashboard select Code / Open with GitHub Desktop .  If you haven't already cloned the repo, that process will start.  If you have the repo will open in GitHub Desktop.
When prompted how you are planning to use this fork, select "For my own purposes" and press continue.

Select "Show in Explorer" from the Repository menu to view the files of your repository in Windows Explorer.  
Open Unity Hub and select the Projects tab from the left sidebar
Select New to create a new project, using one of the supported versions of Unity such as version 2022.3. 
Select the 3D template, name the project “Prototype 1”, and set the location to your  “createwithcode-name” repository folder.   You may need to scroll to see the location path!
Select Create, then wait for Unity to open your new project.
Navigate to your repository folder, and copy the _UnityProjectRoot.gitignore file into your newly created "Prototype 1" Unity project folder.
Rename the copied file to .gitignore
In Github Desktop, make sure your number of changes are reasonable, there should only be about 20-40 changed files (see below).  If it's in the tens of thousands check you've properly renamed the gitignore file and ask your teacher for help.  DO NOT COMMIT if you have too many files.
Add a meaningful commit message such as "Initial commit of project name" and click Commit
Click Push to push the committed changes to GitHub. Remember you'll need to go to GitHub to create, review and merge a pull request on GitHub.com to finish applying your commits to the repository.
Continue working locally and committing frequently. You should at least do one COMMIT and one PUSH per class period. More is better!
If you have NOT created your Unity project locally yet
Create a new repository using this repository as a template.
Select "Use this template".
Name the new repository the same name you'll use for your Unity Project name followed by -Repo.
Using Git GUI, Clone the new repository to your desktop
In the Unity Hub, create a new project with same name as the repository minus the -Repo. Be sure to set the location for the project as the new Repo folder. This way the new Unity project will be created inside the repository folder, at same level as Art and Design folders.
Once the project opens in Unity, go to File Explorer and Move the _UnityProjectRoot.gitignore file up into your Unity project folder and rename to .gitignore
In Git GUI, click Rescan. Make sure that your project files show up and number of files is reasonable (should not be 10's of thousands of files)
Click Stage changed
Add a meaningful commit message such as "Initial commit of project name" and click Commit _Note: If you may need to close the Unity project.
Click Push to push the committed changes to GitHub. Remember you'll need to go to GitHub to create, review and merge a pull request on GitHub.com to finish applying your commits to the repository.
Continue working locally and committing frequently. You should at least do one COMMIT and one PUSH per day to minimize risk of lost work.
